# rate-limit-probot

A Probot app that supports a `/debug` command in issue and pull request comments which helps debugging rate limit issues with Probot apps.

## Usage

### /debug rate_limit

Creates a comment with the [current rate limit status](http://octokit.github.io/rest.js/#octokit-routes-rateLimit).  
_Note that GitHub App installations may have a higher rate limit depending on number of users and repositories, see [here](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/understanding-rate-limits-for-github-apps/)._
